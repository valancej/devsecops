# What is DevSecOps?

At Anchore we consistently work with our users and customers to improve the security of their container images. During these conversations, there is typically an initiative to embed container image scanning into CI/CD pipelines to meet **__DevSecOps__** goals. But what do we mean when we say **__DevSecOps__**? We can think of **__DevSecOps__** as empowering enginering teams to take ownership of how their products will perform in production by integrating security practices into their existing automation and DevOps workflow. A core principle of DevSecOps is creating a 'Security as Code' culture. Now that's there is increased transpency and collaboration, security is now everyone's responsbility. By building on the cultural changes of the DevOps framework, security teams are added to DevOps initiatives early to help plan for security automation. Addtionaly, security engineers should constantly be providing feedback and educating both Ops and development teams on best practices.

## What are the benefits of DevSecOps?

There are quite a few benefits to including security practices to the software development and delivery lifecycle. I've defined some of the core ones below although there are many others:

- Costs are reduced by uncovering and fixing security issues further left in the development lifecycle versus in production environments.
- Speed of product delivery is increased by incorporating automated security tests versus adding security testing at the end of lifecycle.
- Increased transparency and team collaboration leads to faster detection and recovery of threats. 
- Implementing immutable infrastructure improves overall security by reducing vulnerabilites, increasing automation, and encourages organizations to move to the cloud.
