# What is DevSecOps?

At Anchore we consistently work with our users and customers to improve the security of their container images. When we speak to our users, they are typically in the process of embedding container image scanning into their CI/CD pipelines to meet their **__DevSecOps__** goals. But what do we mean when we say **__DevSecOps__**? We can think of **__DevSecOps__** as empowering enginering teams to take ownership of how their products will perform in production by integrating security practices into their existing automation and DevOps workflow. A core principle of DevSecOps is creating a 'Security as Code' culture. Now that's there is increased transpency and collaboration, security is now everyones responsbility. By building on the cultural changes of the DevOps framework security teams are added to the DevOps initiatives early-on to help plan for security automation. Addtionaly, security engineers should constantly be providing feedback and educating both Ops and development teams.
